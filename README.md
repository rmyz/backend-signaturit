# Backend-Signaturit

## About

This is the `Full stack` coding challenge of Signaturit.
This project is structured as a `Clean Architecture`, following `Domain Driven Design`, with the principles of `Clean Code` and `SOLID`.

## Commands

First of all, we need to install the project:

```
  npm i
```

And you need to create an `.env` file in the root of the project with the following content:

```
PORT=3025
```

After that, we can both launch the dev server or the test runner.

To launch the dev server:

```
  npm run start
```

To run the tests:

```
  npm run test
```
